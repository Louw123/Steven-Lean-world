Introduction

Ruby: Before We begin, we must learn abot how lean shows proofs.


Lets see an example proof:
```
A: ℕ
B: ℕ (Objects (Optional))
C:A=B (Assumpions (optional))
⊢ A=B (Goal)
```
Ruby: The Objects are the names of the items.
They are allways asccoiated with a type (in this case ℕ).

The assumptions named statments, akin to objects.

The goal, is where you change the statments.

This is where tactics come in.

Ruby: Tactics are importtant to lean. Tactics are used to change, create, and close goals.
Lets see some tactics.
